An example of the control hierarchy addressed by the SWC software modeling
process is shown in Table 10-4. At the top level, the Sequencer subsystem
orchestrates the operational workflow of high-level processes, such as telescope
pointing and acquisition. At intermediate levels, control and operational logic
dictate how to carry out the commanded operations. At the lowest levels, control
demands are sent to devices that produce telescope axis motion. The purpose of
the SWC software modeling process is to enable physical control that accurately
captures the operating principles of the observatory.
