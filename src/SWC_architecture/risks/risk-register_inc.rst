Risk Register
-------------

The Software and Controls risks currently maintained in the risk register are
summarized in the following tables. The tables below show :ref:`medium exposure
risks <medium_risks>` for the SWC Design and Development Phase, and :ref:`low
exposure risks <low_risks>`.  Note that the SWCS does not have high exposure
risks.
