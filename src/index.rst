  Version 1.0 is out!  The purpose of v1.0 documentation is currently limited to
  showing how to configure, start and monitor services (using logging and
  telemetry as examples), how to establish a communication network, and finally,
  how to setup a device control system.  Future versions of this document will
  add other information as the development progresses.
