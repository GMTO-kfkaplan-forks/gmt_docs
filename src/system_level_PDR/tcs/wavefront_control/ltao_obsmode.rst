*Laser Tomographic Adaptive Optics (LTAO)*
..........................................

A simplified block diagram of the LTAO WFC is presented in Figure 10-27. There
are strong similarities to the NGSAO WFC, with the LTWS taking the place of the
NGWS. The LTAO Wavefront Controller has three additional outputs controlling the
OIWFS DM, the LTWS focus stage, and the LGSF steering mirrors. At this level of
detail, the additional NGS tip-tilt and focus control loops and the details of
the pseudo open-loop tomographic control are hidden within the LTAO Wavefront
Controller. The Phasing Controller in the LTAO mode has additional inputs from
the OIWFS, Phasing Camera, and M1 and M2 Edge Sensors. The operation of the
Active Optics Wavefront Controller is identical to the NGSAO mode.
