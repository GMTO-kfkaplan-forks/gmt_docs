Frameworks
----------

The hardware and software components required for operations derive from a
process of domain engineering.  This result in a set of categories around which
to design a framework that implements architectural patterns (e.g., Controller,
Pipeline) and common components.  The domain engineering process shows that many
subsystems share common architecture and many components share similar
solutions.  The Component Framework includes the following elements:  Core
Framework, Device Control Framework, Data Processing Framework, Time
Distribution Framework, User Interface Framework, and I/O Framework.
