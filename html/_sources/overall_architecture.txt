Overall Architecture
====================

A system as multifaceted and complex as the GMT has many characteristics to
specify and design, e.g. the system organization, operations, physical and
behavioral properties, the control hierarchy, communication and interaction of
the subcomponents under control, use by human operators, etc..  This means that
there are many ways to describe how a system works, all of which come together
to form a complete and coherent picture of the overall system, and further
refined into technical and operational requirements.  The software architecture
captures decisions that best meet those requirements, while optimizing over
parameters in performance, reliability, maintainability, and cost.

The discussion below gives a cross-sectional view of the overall SWCS
architecture, from the standpoint of the SWCS organization, the global SWCS
domains, software development layers, software deployment layers, control
hierarchy, system health and supervision, software frameworks, and the subsystem
modules.  More detailed discussions are provided in the appropriate links.
