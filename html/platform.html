<p>This section provides a description of the technologies used in the development
of the GMT SWC System.  It is the responsibility of the SWCS to define the
platform that can meet operational requirements, thus most of the
platform-related requirements are located in Hardware and Software Standard
documents.</p>
<p>Several criteria play an important role in evaluating the platform technologies:
technical, long-term availability, commercial and community support, and cost
effectiveness. Fortunately, several choices are available both in the commercial
and open source world to address the requirements of the GMT Software and
Controls, making feasible several architecture platforms that will provide an
adequate implementation. The SWCS platform is based on the use of
well-established industrial standards, commercial off-the-shelf, and open source
products while custom-built solutions are strongly discouraged. Design choices
and prescribed standards come about through prototyping, benchmarking and
evaluations. Other guidelines considered include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Avoiding proprietary or vendor lock-in options when several solutions based
on open standards or even open source already exist,</li>
<li>Avoiding niche market solutions when alternatives exist from competitive
markets, especially where economy of scale plays an important role (e.g.,
industrial automation).</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The GMT project office has evaluated54 several technologies as part of its
preliminary design work, ranging from mature to more emergent. Preliminary
evaluations show that a design based on widely available industrial open
standards and open source products is capable of meeting the GMT Control System
requirements. A set of guidelines and requirements regarding the use of these
technologies in the project is included in the Software and Controls Handbook16.</p>
<div class="section" id="computing-platform">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Computing Platform<a class="headerlink" href="#computing-platform" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Device Control Subsystems are deployed in standardized GMT Device Control
Computers (DCCs), while general processing components are deployed in Data
Processing Computers (DPCs).</p>
<p>Two types of DCCs are supported: Intel Industrial Computers (PCs) running Linux
and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). In addition to the obvious benefits
of maintainability and cost-effectiveness, the use of standardized computer
architecture ensures that software components can adequately and robustly
compile and deploy on them.</p>
<p>PC based DCCs running Linux with real time extensions are used in the following
use cases:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The Device Control Subsystem has to be integrated with the low latency
network.</li>
<li>High computing performance is required.</li>
<li>Complex operation scenarios.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>PLCs are used in the following use cases:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The bandwidth necessary for telemetry is low.</li>
<li>Simple supervision, coordination or operation scenarios.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="section" id="computer-hardware">
<h3><em>Computer Hardware</em><a class="headerlink" href="#computer-hardware" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The current baseline consists of standard off-the-shelf data center class
computers. Table 10-78 presents the characteristics of the computer platform.
The interface with field devices is done using EtherCAT, a real-time Ethernet
based fieldbus, which only requires the availability of standard network ports.
This is in contrast with backplane-based systems (e.g., VME, PXI) where the
field interface is implemented with cards connected to the backplane. Section
10.4.2.1 describes with more detail the characteristics of EtherCAT. The fact
that modern motor drivers include embedded motion controllers and even some
local logic by means of a PLC reduces the performance requirements on the
computing platform. As a consequence computers can be very compact. Data center
class computers are used to improve system reliability (e.g., redundant power
supplies). This configuration has been used during prototyping activities. The
physical and power consumption envelope of these computers will be optimized
once the project approaches its deployment phase.</p>
<p>Some of the computer components are optional as their use depends on the
functions performed by the software components deployed in them. For example,
DCCs require access to the fieldbus, but many of them do not require access to
the low latency network. DPCs do not require access to the fieldbus, but require
high capacity storage for quick processing of intermediate results.</p>

<p>The figure below provides the description of the two control subsystem
deployment architectures. The choice between one over the other is part of the
TCS architecture design process and will be analyzed in a case-by-case basis
during detailed design. Examples of the Single Tier Control configuration are
the Mount Control System or the M1 Control System. The Enclosure Control System
follows the Two Tier Control design as it fits the capabilities of the
industrial companies that may procure the low-level control system integrated
with the rest of the enclosure.</p>

<h3><em>PLCs</em><a class="headerlink" href="#plcs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs, PACs and Soft PLCs) are used in several
specific areas, as in the case of the Enclosure for rotating the dome and
commanding shutters and wind vents. PLCs are required to use the IEC 61131-3
programming standard widely adopted in industry. This part of IEC 61131
specifies the syntax and semantics of a unified suite of programming languages
for programmable controllers. These consist of two textual languages:
Instruction List and Structured Text, and two graphical languages: Ladder
Diagram and Function Block Diagram. Also, Sequential Function Chart elements are
defined for structuring the internal organization of programmable controller
programs and function blocks55.</p>
<p>Programmable controllers are integrated with the rest of the Observatory using
the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) communications standard56. OPC UA is the
next generation OPC standard that provides a cohesive, secure and reliable cross
platform framework for access to real time and historical data and events57.</p>
<p>PLCopen provides another important programming solution to the wide range of
selectable motion control hardware available. PLCopen motion standard provides a
way to have standard application libraries that are reusable for multiple
hardware platforms. This lowers development, maintenance, and support costs
while eliminating confusion. Standardization comes about by defining libraries
of reusable components so that the programming is less hardware dependent,
increasing the reusability of the application software, and enabling the
application to scale across different control solutions58.</p>
<p>Currently the suite of PLCopen Motion Control Specifications consists of 6
parts, of which GMT will adopt Part 1: Function Blocks for Motion Control59.</p>
<p>A Soft PLC is a control software engine that runs on standard CPUs such as
Intel, ARM, PowerPC, etc. Combining the features of a PLC (such as I/O control,
PID, ladder logic, standard industrial communication protocols) with the power
of computers (e.g., data handling, logging, running multiple applications
simultaneously, communications over standard networks, user functions, database
interfaces) a Soft PLC provides the most comprehensive industrial control
solution on the market. The GMT’s preferred choice for soft PLC is the TwinCAT
PLC automation software. TwinCAT PLC engine runs on a standard PC/IPC hardware.
It has a real-time kernel with a cycle time typically on the order of
microseconds, with a choice of fieldbus including EtherCAT. TwinCAT PLC offers
all the languages in the IEC 61131-3 standard and has a powerful development
environment for programs whose code size and data regions far exceed the
capacities of conventional PLC systems.</p>

<h3><em>Operating Systems</em><a class="headerlink" href="#operating-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Low-latency, deterministic, system performance is required for real-time control
and signal processing applications that must respond to external events in a
predictable manner, independently of other considerations and particularly the
workload. Furthermore, low jitter operation of the fieldbus master is required
for some elaborate control loops (e.g., multi-axis interpolation) and for high
rate, low jitter, telemetry sampling. For those reasons, digital or motion
control applications are often built on top of a real-time operating system that
specially addresses:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>concurrent, multi-tasking applications</li>
<li>task scheduling and priority policies</li>
<li>deterministic, low latency responses</li>
<li>interfaces to hardware</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Several benchmarks60 and tests have been performed in order to assess the
adequacy of several Linux real-time extensions. The Linux kernel / GNU-Linux
operating system has a long track record of reliability for server and embedded
systems, and excellent soft real-time performance. RT_PREEMPT is very flexible
and actively developed, and has the performance needed for all control systems
requirements considered so far.</p>
<p>A typical control loop requires periodic execution at a predefined rate. Linux
offers different kinds of timers, depending on hardware availability. The High
Resolution Timers introduced in kernel 2.6 provide nanosecond resolution. The
next two Figures show the results of some of the tests performed. The tests
include also the performance of the EtherCAT master stack.</p>

<p>The above Figure shows a high resolution timer benchmark at 2KHz. In this
benchmark, a callback is scheduled to run every 500 microseconds, generating a
square waveform using a digital output channel on the host. The waveform is
captured on an oscilloscope where timing accuracy and jitter are measured.</p>

<p>The above Figure shows a high-resolution timer benchmark now at 8 kHz. A callback

The oscilloscope triggers on the rising edge; the green curve can be ignored as
EtherCAT response was being tested in parallel. Over 3.5 million samples
collected, the signal shows a (static) clock skew of 330 nanoseconds (125.00 -
124.670), maximum jitter of 29 microseconds with 517 nanoseconds rms.</p>

<span id="field-device-interface"></span><h2>Field Device Interface Technology<a class="headerlink" href="#field-device-interface-technology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Industrial fieldbuses have in the last few years moved from serial based
protocols like CAN or Profibus to Ethernet-based protocols. Ethernet-based
protocols are a successor of the VME backplanes used in previous generation
telescopes and have become one of the most common ways to connect input/output
modules with control processors, especially in industrial automation. These
protocols are based on industrial standards, which tend to be long-lived and
very stable, making them an ideal choice for the time span of the GMT project.
Among the different alternatives, EtherCAT is the most attractive: in addition
to being an ISO/IEC standard, several implementations of its components (e.g.,
master and slave stacks) are available on many platforms, including open source
alternatives.</p>
<p>EtherCAT is used to connect hardware devices (e.g., sensors and actuators) to
the fieldbus via Input/Output modules (IOModules). These modules implement
device profile standards based on the CAN Open specifications, for example the
CiA 402: CANopen device profile for drives and motion control (internationally
standardized in IEC 61800-7-201 and IEC 61800-7-301). In this way, the interface
protocol with local controllers is defined by standard profiles, often available
as XML files, thereby guaranteeing the availability of components from different
vendors. Interfaces based on industrial protocols reduce the systems engineering
burden and greatly facilitate the definition of control interfaces.</p>
<p>The field interface technology is greatly influenced by industrial automation
devices, which are becoming increasingly smart, as low-level motion controllers
are embedded directly in the field devices, reducing the need for separate
external control loops. With many control loops closed locally at the drives
level, the control computers in the electronic cabinets can be drastically
reduced in size and in many cases might not be needed at all.</p>
<p>The SWCS field device interface requirement is given by ELS-8030, Field Bus
Standard: The standard field bus shall be EtherCAT.</p>
<div class="section" id="ethercat">
<h3><em>EtherCAT</em><a class="headerlink" href="#ethercat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The GMT standard Ethernet fieldbus is EtherCAT61, which is used to connect field
devices to DCCs (both PCs and PLCs) through IOModules. In general, all the
deployment cases can be grouped in:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>DCCs connected to field devices via slave IOModules. This case is the most
common and is supported by a variety of different vendors. A very frequent
instance is, for example, Digital/Analog EtherCAT modules and motor drivers
– also called smart drives – which from a logical perspective are considered
IOModules, too.</li>
<li>DCCs connected to field devices directly. In this case the slave field
device has a fieldbus interface built in, for example, in the case of
EtherCAT encoders.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Fieldbus cabling between DCCs and the first bus coupler is Ethernet. The
connection between the first bus coupler installed in the electronics room and
the rest of the bus couplers in the bus is optical fiber. This is done via an
optical fiber trunk cable to a distribution panel in a control cabinet inside
the telescope chamber. The control cabinets are located in strategic places of
the telescope structure. Inside the cabinet the field bus cable is converted
from fiber to copper. The cabling between the control cabinet and the device
power cabinets is done using CAT5e/CAT6 industrial Ethernet cables that are
robust, cost effective, and provide a reliable connection technology. The
IOModules are connected to DCCs using a cable redundancy arrangement. The
status of DC power supplies and their corresponding protections are monitored,
and potential free contacts are provided for the wiring in the GMT Power
cabinets.  The master fieldbus DCC uses the IgH EtherCAT master in order to
communicate with the IOModules connected to the fieldbus.</p>
<p>GMT has performed extensive testing connecting EtherCAT remote IOModules and
motion drives with real-time computers via fiber optics62. The tests, using
cycle times between 0.1 and 0.5 milliseconds (time to read inputs, process
them and write outputs from the real time computer), have shown a remarkable
stability. This solution makes it possible to locate the control computers in
the electronics room instead of the telescope structure. The consequences of
this arrangement are: less heat dissipation, space and mass required in the
telescope enclosure, major cost reduction, and easier maintenance. The Figure
below shows an example of how GMT will deploy the DCC, IOModules and field
devices for the case of the Acquisition and Guiding Wavefront Sensor System.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_static/EtherCAT-AGWS.png" src="_static/EtherCAT-AGWS.png" />
<p class="caption">EtherCAT topology sample for the Acquisition and Guiding Wavefront Sensor System.</p>
</div>
<p>GMT will adopt the CiA 402 CANopen device profile for drives and motion control,
which is suitable for frequency inverters, servo controllers, and stepper
motors. It is internationally standardized in IEC 61800-7-163 and IEC
61800-7-20164. The fact that the CiA402 profile type directly maps to EtherCAT
network technology in the IEC 61800-7-30165 standard speaks to the robustness
and long term stability of EtherCAT technology.</p>

<h3><em>Electronic Cabinets</em><a class="headerlink" href="#electronic-cabinets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div>GMT has defined a Standard Electronics Cabinet (SEC) to be used by all
subsystems, to the extent possible, for the integration of their electronics.
The SEC includes a cooling system to maintain the air temperature inside the
cabinet near ambient and a power distribution unit for providing electrical
power to the subsystems. The SECs will be purchased, modified, and configured
by GMT and will be provided to the subsystem teams, as requested, for

<div><p>Terminal Block technology plays an important role in the GMT design. Robust
wiring connections are essential to ensuring reliable and stable communication
between field elements and the electronics. Among the many variants existing
in the market today, the Push-In Technology (PIT) is preferred. PIT allows
connections whereby solid conductors or conductors with ferrules directly
insert into the terminal block. Only a flat-head screwdriver is necessary to
insert the wire and, in many cases, requires no tools at all. With PIT’s latch
function there is no need for special tools; using the integrated actuation
lever one can release the connected conductors quickly and easily. Vibration,
shock, and corrosion resistances are all covered by industrial standards
compliance. A few other Terminal Block features that are highly useful are
double function shafts that allow plug- in bridges and openings for test point
contacts. See the figure below for a couple of examples on the PIT terminal
block technology with bridges and test points adopted by GMT.</p>

<span id="id3"></span><h2>Time Distribution System<a class="headerlink" href="#time-distribution-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While individual subsystems often provide their own internal clock(s), quality
and accuracy of (crystals) varies vastly between systems. A time distribution
system allows a heterogeneous set of controllers to reference and to synchronize
to the same master clock, and to share the same notional measure of time within
a distributed framework. Time systems are commonly layered into strata,
referring to how far each clock is located from the reference clock. For
telescope applications, a GPS clock (stratum 1) heads the hierarchy and acts as
the grand master clock.</p>
<p>A time system is particularly relevant for the GMT Telescope where time
synchronization plays an important role in many areas. In calculating a
telescope slew trajectory, for example, the telescope kernel pointing
coordinates must be computed using the GPS time; or for calculating continuous
drive demands, where it is necessary to interpolate between time stamps; or for
telemetry case, where uniform timestamps must be used to correlate real-time and
archive data.</p>
<div class="section" id="time-distribution-protocols">
<h3><em>Time Distribution Protocols</em><a class="headerlink" href="#time-distribution-protocols" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The most popular time distribution protocols are the Network Time Protocol
(NTP), the Inter-range Instrumentation Group code B (IRIG-B) and the Precision
Time Protocol (PTP). Their main characteristics are described in the following
list:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>NTP is the de-facto standard for computer clusters. NTP assets include:
platform independence, availability on all operating systems, and simple
deployment relying on ubiquitous Ethernet connection. NTP precision is
limited by unaccounted network transmission delays, and susceptibility to
changes in the network topology.</li>
<li>IRIG-B is commonly used by 8-10m class telescopes and other major
experimental physics control systems. More accurate synchronization is
achieved in this case using a dedicated hardware clock and connection.
IRIG-B effectively builds a time bus concept that features specialized
components (hardware, software drivers, etc.) making it somewhat cumbersome
and often time-consuming to implement, adding extra burden to the deployment
(dedicated networks of coaxial cables are needed) and increasing the
implementation cost (specialized hardware for all sub-systems is required).</li>
<li>PTP emerged more recently in the distributed cluster world. It addresses
deficiencies of NTP, offering more accurate timestamps (thanks to
synchronization packets) and accounting for transmission delays in the
network. The second revision of the protocol achieves further accuracy by
using specialized network interface cards (NICs) and transparent clocks. The
NICs can provide hardware timestamp, so the nearer to the hardware the
timestamps are generated the higher the precision.</li>
</ul>

<h3><em>Precision Time Protocol</em><a class="headerlink" href="#precision-time-protocol" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<div>A growing number of industrial and power utility tasks require the use of
time-synchronized networks. Traditionally, timing information was distributed
via a dedicated network separate from the main application, such as real-time
distribution protocols, of which IRIG-B is perhaps the best known. More
recently, the market has shifted to a single converged data and distributed
timing network based on standard Ethernet running IEEE1588 Precision Time
Protocol as part of the application layer. The protocol can achieve
sub-microsecond synchronization performance over distributed networks. The
IEEE15888 Standard is currently in its 2nd revision.</div></blockquote>

<h3><em>Lab Evaluation</em><a class="headerlink" href="#lab-evaluation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Several PTP topologies to measure synchronization accuracy have been tested at
the GMT lab67. A common arrangement is shown in Figure below:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_static/PTP-master-slaves.png" src="_static/PTP-master-slaves.png" />
<p class="caption">PTP Master with 2 Slaves Arrangement using a Switched Network and a Dedicated
NIC.</p>
</div>
<p>Two slave computers were synchronized with PTP and each was generating a
digital pulse over the serial communications port at 10 Hz. The test was
carried out over a private LAN using one dedicated NIC isolated from the
intranet and another NIC that was running the EtherCAT master in the
background. The daemon used for the test was the ptpd-2 open source stack.</p>
<p>Synchronization accuracy was measured with an oscilloscope, capturing the
delay and variation between the two independently generated pulses as shown in
the Figure below. Over one million samples – which at 10 pulses per second
translates roughly into 27 hours – the standard deviation is less than 2.5us
and representative of PTP stability. The min/max outliers amplitude at &lt; 25us
falls within the technology accepted published figures.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_static/PTP-synchronization-accuracy.png" src="_static/PTP-synchronization-accuracy.png" />
<p class="caption">Lab PTP Synchronization Accuracy Tests</p>
</div>
<p>During the tests a couple of disturbances were introduced to evaluate the
synchronization robustness. First some network traffic was initiated,
essentially copying the entire file system from the master machine to an
external computer outside the PTP LAN (directing the traffic to the general
LAN). The accuracy in this case did not seem to be affected. Next, the
machine was artificially loaded at lower priority, leaving the non-isolated
CPU with 100% effective load. No evident effect on timing accuracy was
observed.</p>
<p>A summary with all the measured quantities using a ptpd-2 implementation of
the Linux PTP Software Stack is presented in the following Table:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The PTP network tested before was reconfigured to work over the common LAN,
using now the same NIC for PTP synchronization and general networking. The
table below shows the statistics obtained over the common LAN case, and as
expected, the performance is slightly worse (about 60%) than using a dedicated
LAN.</p>

<p>For optimal performance with EtherCAT, a patched driver for the fieldbus
enabled NIC was used. During the tests, some interactions between the PTP
daemon and the driver were observed, right when the EtherCAT master was
started and the patched driver for the NIC got loaded. The issue can be
addressed by sequencing the access to the NIC, for example by stopping the PTP
daemon while EtherCAT initializes and then running it again after EtherCAT has
started.</p>
<p>In summary, PTP has several advantages for time distribution and
synchronization in a widely distributed system as GMT:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Easy and inexpensive to implement using a LAN infrastructure</li>
<li>Common and proven technology</li>
<li>Guaranteed long time support</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>However, a pure software solution may not be enough for a system requiring
very high timing resolution stability. The numbers collected during these
tests are consistent with the literature and leave no reason to doubt hardware
solutions could bring sub-microsecond accuracy. For the GMT Telescope Control,
a more detailed system analysis should be carried out if 5-50 microsecond
accuracy is necessary.</p>

<span id="distributed-communications"></span><h2>Distributed Communications - Middleware<a class="headerlink" href="#distributed-communications-middleware" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a distributed control system the use of middleware enables communication
between different components deployed in different processes or computers. This
makes middleware software pervasive. A middleware agnostic architecture allows
the decoupling of applications from the specific implementation. The SWCS
communication requirement is given by SWC-6879, Communication Protocols: SWCS
shall define a set of software protocols and APIs that allow the communication
with the required performance between different components.</p>
<p>ZeroMQ is used for communications between distributed components, chosen for its
desirable features. Given that the project is in early stages and that the
infrastructure software is likely to continue evolving, this selection can be
revised in the future as fitting. Front–end software deployed in a browser uses
WebSockets to communicate with the rest of the distributed components. The
serialization/deserialization of transmitted data packages is accomplished using
MessagePack68.</p>
<p>GMT is developing several prototypes to validate the use of these technologies.
These prototypes include the use of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a> databases like Mongodb, scripting
languages like <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript">Coffeescript</a>, user
interface libraries based on HTML5 and SVG like <a class="reference external" href="http://d3js.org">d3.js</a>,
event-driven environments like node.js or high performance middleware libraries
like zeromq, MessagePack or ProtocolBuffers.</p>

<p>Telescope Control Systems span a large dynamic range in bandwidth and latency
requirements. Most systems have fairly relaxed requirements on bandwidth and
latency, e.g., the telescope main axis require few parameters to update at
nominally 20 Hz, which is easily handled by off-the-shelf Ethernet components. A
few other systems such as wavefront control and Adaptive Optics run at kHz
regime, shuffling orders of magnitude larger data volume in real time to read
out telemetry and WFS, computing wavefront slopes, commanding ASMs, etc.</p>
<p>The global trend in High Performance Computing and Ethernet communications
drives rapid developments in the industry, somewhat comparable to CPUs (Moore&#8217;s
law) seen in the previous decade. The emphasis on inter-connected cloud
computing, and the ever-growing bandwidth and low latency requirements, continue
to drive the technology today. Recent trends from high performance computing
community, coupled with cost-benefit components, point to Infiniband* as a safe
choice in the present and for future growth.</p>
